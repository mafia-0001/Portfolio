Personal Portfolio Webpage
![Demo Preview](preview.gif)

Hi! 👋 I am a **beginner in web development**, and this is my first portfolio project.  
I built this website using only **HTML** to practice the basics and to understand how websites are structured.

---

## 🚀 What I Learned
- How to use **HTML5 semantic tags** (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`).
- How to organize content on a page.
- How to host a website for free using **GitHub Pages**.

## 📂 Tech Used
- ✅ HTML5 only  
- ❌ No CSS yet  
- ❌ No JavaScript yet  

---

## 🎯 Future Plans
- Add **CSS** for styling (colors, layout, fonts).  
- Make it **responsive** so it works on mobile.  
- Add **JavaScript** for interactivity (like form validation).
